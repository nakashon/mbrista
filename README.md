## What is this?

MetBarista is a free, open-source PWA that connects directly to your [Meticulous](https://meticuloushome.com) espresso machine over your local WiFi. No cloud, no account, no subscription — your machine IP is the only thing you need.

### Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| 🎛 **Dashboard** | Live machine status, sensor tiles (temp/weight/pressure), controls (start, stop, preheat, tare, purge) |
| 📋 **Profiles** | Browse all profiles on your machine with cover images + generative pressure-curve fingerprints |
| 📈 **Shot History** | Every shot with full telemetry charts (pressure, flow, weight, temperature) |
| 📡 **Live Monitor** | Real-time shot data — state, temp, weight, pressure, timer + live chart as the shot builds |
| 🔬 **Compare** | Side-by-side shot comparison |
| ✏️ **Create** | Build new pressure/flow profiles from scratch |
| 🌐 **Community** | Firmware changelog, company updates, resources |
| 📤 **Share** | Export profiles in OEPF format |

### Philosophy

> **Machine = Identity.** Connecting your Meticulous IS your login. No OAuth, no passwords, no accounts. If you own a machine, you're part of the community.

Everything runs in your browser. MetBarista talks directly to `http://{your-machine-ip}/api/v1/` — the same API the official app uses.

---

## HTTP vs HTTPS & Live Data

MetBarista is served over both HTTP and HTTPS at `metbarista.com`.

**Live telemetry** (socket polling to your local machine IP) requires the browser to make requests to `http://192.168.x.x` — a private network address. Modern browsers enforce the [Private Network Access](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/private-network-access-update/) spec which restricts this in certain HTTPS contexts.

### In practice

| Context | REST API (controls, profiles) | Live Telemetry (socket polling) |
|---|---|---|
| `http://metbarista.com` | ✅ Works | ✅ Works |
| `https://metbarista.com` | ✅ Works (machine returns correct CORS headers) | ✅ Works (machine returns `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://metbarista.com`) |
| Mobile browser | ✅ Works | ✅ Works |

### If live data stops working

The machine uses socket.io EIO4 HTTP long-polling (not WebSocket). MetBarista implements this manually via `fetch()` to avoid library quirks. The session stays alive by responding to the machine's ping packets (`"2"`) with pong (`"3"`) every 10 seconds.

If your browser blocks socket polling (you'll see `err` in the Live badge):
1. **Chrome desktop:** Go to `chrome://net-internals/#hsts` → search `metbarista.com` → Delete (clears the HSTS cache that forces HTTPS)
2. **Try `http://metbarista.com`** directly — HTTP works for all features

## Getting Started (contributors)

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- A Meticulous machine on your local network (or the IP doesn't matter for UI work)

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nakashon/metbarista.git
cd metbarista
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # add your own keys (optional — app works without them)
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Environment variables

The app works fully without any env vars. They only enable optional features:

| Variable | Purpose | Required |
|---|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_FEEDBACK_TOKEN` | GitHub Issues PAT for the feedback button | Optional |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CF_ANALYTICS_TOKEN` | Cloudflare Web Analytics beacon token | Optional |

See `.env.example` for setup instructions.

> **Note:** The live site at metbarista.com uses its own keys injected at build time via GitHub Actions secrets. Contributors use their own keys (or none at all).

## Architecture

```
Browser (PWA)
    │
    ├── metbarista.com (GitHub Pages, static export)
    │       └── Next.js 15 · Tailwind v4 · Recharts
    │
    ├── http(s)://192.168.x.x/api/v1/  ← your Meticulous, local network only
    │       ├── REST API  — machine info, profiles, shot history, actions
    │       └── Socket.io EIO4 polling — live sensor data (temp, pressure, flow, weight, time)
    │
    └── metbarista-feed-proxy.metbarista.workers.dev  ← Cloudflare Worker
            └── Proxies meticuloushome.com Atom feeds (firmware changelog etc.)
```

**No server. No database. No user data leaves your network.**

## Machine API

The Meticulous machine exposes a local HTTP API (same as the official app):

```
GET  /api/v1/machine                  → machine info (name, serial, firmware)
GET  /api/v1/profile/list?full=true   → all profiles with full stage data
GET  /api/v1/history                  → shot history list
GET  /api/v1/history/{id}             → single shot telemetry
POST /api/v1/action/{name}            → action: start | stop | preheat | tare | purge | home | abort
```

### Live telemetry (socket.io EIO4 polling)

```
GET  /socket.io/?EIO=4&transport=polling          → open session, returns {sid, pingInterval, pingTimeout}
POST /socket.io/?EIO=4&transport=polling&sid=...  → body "40" to join namespace
GET  /socket.io/?EIO=4&transport=polling&sid=...  → poll for events
```

Events received:
- `status` → `{name, state, extracting, loaded_profile, time, profile_time, sensors: {p, f, w, t, g}}`
- `sensors` → raw sensor dump (temperatures, motor position, etc.)

**Important:** The machine sends a ping packet `"2"` every 10 seconds. You must reply with `"3"` (pong) or the session closes. MetBarista handles this automatically in `lib/machine-socket.ts`.
